Using Hive/EMR

1. Go to EMR in the AWS console.  (It's in the Analytics section.)

2. Click "Create Cluster"
	a. Cluster name can be whatever you want

  	b. Leave logging at the default location. This puts the logs in their own 
       bucket, so it's easy to clean them up by deleting the bucket after you're 
       done with the cluster.

  	c. Under Software Configuration, choose the second option, "Core Hadoop".
       The "All Applications" option makes launching take a long time because
       it has to install a lot of applications we don't need.

  	d. Leave instance type at m3.xlarge. I spent a while playing with instance 
       types, and this seems to be the least expensive option that actuall works.
       (Others may fail to launch with complains about the instance type not 
       being available in your availability zone.)

  	e. Select yoru ec2 key pair. You'll need this to log in.

  	f. Click "Create Cluster" at the bottom right.

3. Building the cluster will take a while. Hang in there. Once the status goes 
   to a green "Waiting", you should be good to go.

4. Connect: click the SSH link in the line labeled "Master Public DNS"
   This gives a SSH command you can copy, just like connecting to an EC2
   instance. The line isn't quite the same, though - it expects your key
   pair to be located at the root of your home folder. If that isn't correct
   then you can replace "~/default.pem" with the correct location.

5. Clone our group repo from github.
   	a. Install git:  
   		> sudo yum install git
   	
   	b. Clone repo:
   		> git clone https://[USERNAME]@github.com/SeanU/w205project.git

6. Prepare Hive tables:
	a. Load the billboard data:
		> hive -i ~/w205project/src/sql/billboard.sql

	b. Load the MSD data:
		> hive -i ~/w205project/src/sq/million_song_dataset.sql
