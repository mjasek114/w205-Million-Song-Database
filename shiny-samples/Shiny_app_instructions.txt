Instructions for deploying a Shiny app

1.  Create an R Script file.  Call it app.R.
Start with a Shiny template.  You can add any R code you want
before the Shiny part starts if you need to load data or create
models or whatever.  (You can also split app.R into
ui.R and server.R, but I'm keeping it simple.)

2.  After you run our project install script which installs
Shiny Server, then create the directory
/srv/shiny-server/<your app dir>

3.  Then put your app.R that you created in step 1 in this new
folder.

4.  Then run http://<your amazon instance>:3838.  Your new
folder name should show up in the list and when you click on it
your app.R file should run.
